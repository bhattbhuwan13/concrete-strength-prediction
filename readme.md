# Concrete Strength Prediction

This repo contains solution to a regression problem -"Concrete Strength Prediction".

I tried two different approaches:

* Linear Regression model
* Random Forest Regression model(ensemble)

The models were evaluated using the same training and validation set and on the same metric. The results obtained are as follows:



| Model Name              | R2 score(train) | R2 score(validation) |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| Linear Regression       | 0.60            | 0.64                 |
| Random forest Regressor | 0.98            | 0.92                 |

**From the above table, we see that the random forest model outperforms linear regression model by a huge margin. **
